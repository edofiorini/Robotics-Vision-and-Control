# Robotics-Vision-and-Control
Robotics, Vision and Control course's assignments at UNIVR.
Each folder correspond to one assignment, within there is its  ```main``` file.
### Joint Space Trajectories
The Joint space trajectories implemented are the following one:
- Polynomial trajectories (3th-5th-7th order)
- Cycloidal and Harmonic trajectories
- Trapezoidal trajectory
- Double-S trajectory
- Multi-Point trajectory 

### Model based trajectory
- Trajectory based on torque constraints 
### Operational Space Trajectories
- Linear and Circular primitivies 
### Vision
The topics taken into account are:
- 3D acquisition system
- Image analysis
- 3D analysis
- Hand eye calibration
### UR5 Control Architecture 
```RVC_Cartesian_PD_control_gravity_compensation``` and 
```RVC_Joint_PD_control_gravity_compensation``` are simulink models in order to test the trajectories in a real architectures.
### Results
All the achieved results are shown in the presentation.
